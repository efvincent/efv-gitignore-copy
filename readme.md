# gitignore-copy

You know when you want to copy an entire subfolder of code from one computer
to another, say when you've got a new computer and you're retiring your old one?

You know how you don't want to copy all the built targets and npm module folders?

This utility does that for you, the hard way. Really just an excuse to 
build some more stuff in Rust.
